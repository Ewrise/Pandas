Since we were only there for 24hours, it was a good spot to stay as it was walking distance to the Acropolis and Plaka area. Vesna and Kosta were great at communicating and when we checked in, Kosta was very helpful in explaining the area and everything we needed to know. What was really great was that they had printed maps for us and also a local mobile phone incase we needed to make calls!

The apartment is in an excellent area, 3 minutes walk to the metro station Bastille, with a gorgeous farmer's market each Thursday and Sunday across the street (buy the eggs!). Michiko and her boyfriend were very welcoming during my stay, answering any queries I had about the neighbourhood, and giving some general tips about Paris.The room is a nice size with a comfortable bed, and the place overall has a nice feel to it. Although, some door handles are a little out of order, and the internet works best in the living room. They also have an adorable puppy who is very playful and loving.

9329281,2013-12-03,"This is not our first time to NYC, but this is the first time using AirBnb here. When staying at most hotels in Midtown, you have to expect high prices for ""Holiday Inn"" quality small rooms, despite the hotels rated as 4 or 5 stars. Everything seems old here.Not here. The owner has good taste. The unit is modern and updated. Small but larger than most hotel rooms. We loved the kitchen granite counters, modern kitchen stove, plush rugs, and modern couch. Plus, we get a 1 bedroom unit so that we can let our baby sleep in one room while we get to enjoy watching TV on the large 50-60"" TV in the living room. Surprisingly, there is another huge TV in the bedroom as well which we never used. All ""high definition,"" of course.The owner is very professional and courteous. He answered all of our questions and accommodated all of our needs. When I inquired about a baby crib, he responded by ordering one for us immediately. Also, when we arrived at the unit, he told us that he ordered a high chair for another client but we are welcomed to use it as well. I never used the high chair but it is telling how willing he is to help out. The owner met us in person in the unit and explained rules of the unit. My wife and I felt very comfortable with him. We also noticed that he had fresh red roses on the coffee table for us. Nice touch and good taste!Location is perfect in Midtown with a few minute walk to most train stations, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center. Area is safe!!! We have no worries of our safety or security in the building or surrounding area. Neighbors are quiet and overall seem genuinely nice. We have a view of the street which is not saying much since you are surrounded by other tall building. To be expected and not big deal deal since we are going out to enjoy the town. In the morning while sleeping, we do hear car and street noises. Again to be expected in Midtown. Our baby didn't mind even during her daytime naps!We enjoyed our stay in NYC using this Airbnb unit more than a typical hotel room. It met all of our needs and more so. The owner was great and made this stay a very memorable experience. Thank you.",FANTASTIC TIMES SQUARE ONE BEDROOM,Theater District,New York City,New York,United States,Entire home/apt,260,291

Water pressure in shower was strong, and water hot.Free washer and dryer! Reasonably priced.Free Wifi!Cons:Old house in need of much fixing and a really, really good scrubbing by professional cleaners maybe?Door made explosive sound every time we opened it (probably woke everyone up in building)Large windows facing next door windows, but, alas, no curtains. But that's ok, when we had to get dressed, we turned the lights out, or snuck into the tiny closet.  Privacy is really overrated anyway. Booked for 2, but there was only 1 tiny pillow on bed (no biggie, but you might want to bring your own, and maybe another sheet as there was no top sheet).Bathroom had a very Third World feel to it.

He was also open to all our questions and inquiries. The location was wonderful in consideration of historical landmarks. Situated between 2 Tube Stations. The only problem was the noise level. Every weekday morning the Street Market people start setting up at 6am. And of course you can hear them. Then on the other hand you can hear the noise from the pub next door until about midnight Thur and Fri nights. The house was exactly like stated. We didnt use kitchen so I cant attest to it.

It's a 1.5mi walk to the nearest streetcar stop, so it's not unmanageable.

While I was trying to get ready the fuse blew and it took her awhile to fix it then told us not to have the heater on at the same time as styling tools, which would have been nice to know upfront. Also was frustrated about how much emphasis she put on being quiet, it was to the point she told us to take our shoes off in the elevator so they didn't make noise.

When Venice had a high tide, and we would have been stuck in the apt., she lent us boots so we could get out.With the apt. only a very short walk away from the 4.1 and 4.2 vaporetto, it was in a convenient location, and yet away from the crowds and noise of the more touristy areas.I strongly recommend Fulvia's apt. to anyone staying in Venice, especially if you want to stay more than just a few days.","Gothic Palace gorgeous view, quiet",Cannaregio,Venice,Veneto,Italy,Entire home/apt,120,235

It's about a 15 min walk to the closest Ubahn station (Kortbusser Tor), however there's a bike shop about 3 blocks away where you can rent bikes for 10euros a day. We just kept them in the communal courtyard overnight. Plenty of restaurants / food in the neighborhood streets (our favorite was Zitrone) and Nadine can offer more suggestions!

We have heard great things about Toronto, and it lived up to its billing. Aaron and his wife were great hosts. We wanted privacy and that is why we rented a separate apartment with a stove and laundry. The apartment was perfect for us, with a comfortable bed, and great kitchen with everything one would need if they wanted to cook in. Getting back to the our hosts, they did a great job of communicating with us from the get go, once we were approved for our stay. This made me feel good, in that they seemed to really care that about our experience. When I arrived we got lost, and we called Aaron who directed us to his place. Once again I cannot reiterate that if you want privacy and the ability to take the trolley into Toronto in 45 minutes, this is your place.

14250523,2012-12-06,"The first feature of this space that struck me was the location. If the Frenchmen district were a Monopoly board, this could be the GO tile. Also, the walk from this location to the French Quarter is about the same as from the Business District to the French Quarter, but you would save more money at this location and be immersed in a culturally authentic area. Be certain that the nightlight will be quite audible through the windows, so this is not a location for an early riser. However, it is quite nice to be able to walk right across the street from the bar to your bed.Jasmine has done an effective job renovating the space. There is just enough modernity incorporated to convey a sense of style, comfort, and cleanliness without losing the antique character. An exposed brick fireplace and wood floors reflect the era that produced this structure, and the updated and spacious kitchenette are successfully harmonized with the antique charm.One of the highlights of renting this space was unexpected. Jasmine is an eagerly accommodating hostess, and I found her to be instantly responsive to questions or requests.

It couldn't have been more comfortable. The living area was really spacious, the bedroom & bathroom huge and the kitchen more than enough to accommodate my few attempts to cook myself dinner- but you won't need to because there are so many great places within a short distance. The location is perfect for exploring the best parts of LA- trendy Los Feliz and Silver Lake are so close and you are stumbling distance from the bars and restaurants of Franklin Village. Hollywood and West Hollywood are really close, too. As for the guest wing itself, it felt more like a hotel- Zoe was nice enough to provide me with coffee in advance and the bathroom was equipped with all the little amenities you might need- deodorants, a razor, shampoos & conditioners. The furnishings were warm and cozy and the bed was even more comfortable than my bed at home- perfect for sleeping off jetlag! Zoe and Patrick left me alone but were eager to make sure I was okay and that I had everything I needed- I never felt like they were intrusive but I knew that they were there if anything went wrong. One morning I had no cold water and before I even had a chance to let them know, they had fixed the problem. When I set the fire alarm off one night cooking dinner, Patrick was in seconds later to fix it. I only wish that I hadn't been working every day and had gotten a chance to get to know them a little better or to spend more time sitting in the beautiful lemon garden with a cup of coffee! I'm now living in LA permanently but if I ever had friends coming to visit I'd send them to stay at Zoe and Patrick's in a heartbeat!  ","Charming, Calming Guest Wing!

There were some insects in the kitchen occasionally but this is an old NY building, it is to be expected, and this was something Kim was up front about from the beginning. There were some issues with the toilet but once again Kim was totally honest and up front about this and I'm sure this will have been resolved by the time any future guests stay.

Upon entry it was rather dark and it smelled kinda like a cat lived in there a majority of the time. Also, It was labeled as ""essentials included"" and there was no dish-soap, toilet paper or hair drier. On top of that, the place was definitely not cleaned thoroughly prior to us coming. we had to go out and buy cleaning supplies and sheets for our stay. The only other thing i found odd was the door to the house is always wide open, like held open with a rope. You have a locked door at the bottom of this staircase but the staircase to upstairs is always open 24/7. Didnt like how anyone can enter whenever.BUT! honestly leo was SUPER cool. He even bought the cleaning supplies from us and we left them there. He was sadly out of town when we visted so his friend was watching the place so i dont feel as if this was leo's fault. Because of his generosity, i would honestly give him another chance. Just was surprised of the cleaning fee of $80 just to have to clean up myself.Pros: Quiet safe neghiborhood, Spacious, Right by tons of stores(cvs/kfc/deli), camera watch the house, leo is awesome, leo is super understanding, he checks on you every day, netflix free, wifi free.Cons: Smells of cat urnie(kinda), no cable just netflix, front door to house is wide open 24/7, Pretty hard to park your car late at night, Not clean, Not all the essentials(like toilet paper?)

When we arrived Lisa was kind enough to pick me and my friend up separately as we arrived at different times at a fraction of the cost that a taxi would charge. We stayed in their nautical themed room which was a little cold at times but we had a huge bed with plenty of blankets to keep us warm in the night. It also is a little poor on wifi connection, but fine in the communal areas.

They had great recommendations for things to do in the neighborhood and sent over a personal google doc guide for the city. You couldn't ask for a better location in silverlake.

There are plenty of supermarkets nearby so you can easily store food in the decent sized fridge provided in the room. The toilet, shower, and basin are cleverly designed against one side of the room. Some may consider it tight squeeze, but for any active traveller it is honestly sufficient. There isn't a television but when in Paris and with so much to see, you wouldn't need it. The fast wifi access was useful to my husband and I for planning out our days. Access to all the major sites in Paris is very easy from the 5th arrondissement via the train or on foot. During our stay, Cristina checked in briefly to make sure all of our needs were met. I appreciate the attentiveness.

During the booking period, her replies were prompt and informative. She gave us directions and my friends and I were welcomed with a bowl of fruits, which she generously refilled when one of us arrived late. Her enthusiasm, thoughtfulness, kindness and 'motherly' touch to almost everything that concerns my friends and I, made all of us at home. To validate our claim that we are beyond happy and contented with her warm home,  we even referred her to our operations manager for succeeding students that may enroll to the same university and we even booked her for our return trip to Melbourne. She accompanied us to buy groceries and even bought a dryer for our clothes - in short, as a host, she went extra mile to ensure our contract is justified. Clean and newly washed drapes and basics (e.g. tissue, oil, salt and powdered detergents) were well provided. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. Bus stops are walking distance and you can even enjoy a jog if you prefer. We highly recommend her home and will surely book her should we return to Melbourne.

4138651,2012-08-10,"APARTMENT: Our 1-week stay in Jepis' flat during April 2013 was great! It's spacious, clean, has comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, fully equipped big kitchen to cook and serve anything you'd like, and has a lot of sunlight going into the master bedroom and dining room/living rooms. It's also got wifi that works mostly in the half of the flat closest to the entryway (mud room, smaller bedroom, kitchen, hallway, and part of the living room). The airbnb pictures of the flat are also very accurate.LOCATION: The flat is centrally located and within walking distance to so many attractions and restaurants!  It's just around the corner from La Rambla, less than 2 blocks away from the Passeig de Gracia metro and Casa Batllo, 4 blocks away from La Pedrera/Casa Mila, and 4 blocks away (less than 10 minute walk) from Placa de Catalunya! We were even able to take a nice, long morning walk to Sagrada Familia!  There's also a 24-hour small grocery store called Euro Sol around the corner, and a home supplies store called Servei Estacio (it's like Target/Walmart in the US) a block away---both recommended to us by Jepis.  We couldn't have stayed in a better place!  We made a google map of sites and attractions relative to Jepis' flat, so if you want to see how awesome of a location it's in, you can take a look at our google map ((website hidden)). It's not comprehensive; just lists the main attractions and restaurants that we wanted to visit.HOST: As for Jepis, he is a wonderful host---incredibly nice and welcoming, very responsive to our questions via e-mail and WhatApp messaging, flexible, punctual, and offered to show us around the city and even pick us up from the airport.  He's also thoughtful and generous---I knew I was going to visit La Boqueria to pick up groceries to cook in his kitchen, so before our trip to Barcelona, I asked Jepis if he had a knife, and he said he'd double check.  When we arrived, we found 2 new knives for us to use!  He went out and bought new ones since he didn't think the ones already in the kitchen would be adequate enough for me.  What a thoughtful host!  We also had some trouble starting the washing machine, and he responded very quickly and offered to have someone come check it out.OVERALL: Our stay in Jepis' flat was great.  We were the third guests he's rented to, and I'd recommend others to stay there---especially since Jepis was so cool, and it's centrally located to attractions and public transportation.Thanks again, Jepis!",Beautiful flat in center Barcelona,la Dreta de l'Eixample,Barcelona,Catalonia,Spain,Entire home/apt,90,294

I'm glad to say that our experience was absolutely perfect and would  not hesitate to recommend Nic to anyone. If you have a chance to stay in Montreal, believe me there is no better location nor host than what we had. One of the selling points for us was that the place had been properly photographed. While others forgot to take pictures of certain rooms or areas, Nic was completely thorough in his photography and let us feel that we knew what we were walking into.  Also, his prompt and courteous manner with his replies were greatly appreciated,  I would have my questions answered with just a few hours, which made planning very very easy. This made me feel comfortable, since he clearly took it in a very professional manner. Upon our arrival Nic met us and greeted us warmly, showed us the place. He informed us of local attractions and told us the places to go, the restaurants to eat at and so on.  We took his advice and were thankful for the rest of our trip, heed his sage advice.  The funny thing is, the place actually looks better in real life than the photos; the rooms are great, the bed is super big and soft, the bathroom is beautiful and clean, the kitchen (though a tad on the cozy side) and appliances are in tip top shape.  The kitchen also came fully stocked with Tupperware, cutlery, plates etc, which was a joy and let us cut our bill while in Montreal considerably.  Our stay was made evermore comfortable by the brand new AC unit Nic had purchased that literally cools down the room in about 40 seconds.  We had spare towels at an arms reach and a sunny patio to sit on if we wanted to.  I couldn't be happier with my experience. Not only did Nic give us a great impression of Air BnB, but of the people in Montreal in general. I can't recommend staying here enough.

It was clean and spacious enough for 2 people, but I probably wouldn't try to fit more than that (except for maybe a small child). All the appliances worked properly. Just note that although this place has a little french lift (big enough to fit 2 people or 1 person with a large suitcase) you will still have to navigate stairs as the bedroom is a couple steps down. The place felt very homey and the location is perfect with nice markets nearby and the metro line just a 2 minute walk away from both the Bourse and Sentier stations. Although I never met Giles he was prompt and very friendly as well as helpful with all our communications. He also left us some bread, half and half, juice, butter, jam, and a bottle of wine so that was a very nice touch. His friend Francois greeted us upon arrival and really went that extra mile by showing us how everything worked in the place and he even took an hour to give us a tour of the area where good markets and restaurants were as well as places to avoid. It was really helpful and we were thoroughly impressed as no other host has done that for us before.

He drove me to the shops to get some supplies which was really appreciated and beyond the call of duty!  Inside were supplies including a few breakfasts plus some beer and wine and more.  The location was perfect.  The tube was 100 m away and only two stops from London Bridge. The views from the bedroom and balcony were superb!

22453593,2012-11-22,"It was such a pleasure to stay in this wonderful apartment for four days during our recent trip to Paris. Michael was a fantastic host; he always responded quickly and was incredibly thoughtful throughout the whole process. He left thorough notes on the care of the place, along with great recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood. There were also fresh flowers, a fantastic bottle of red wine, and madeleines in the kitchen. We so appreciated these lovely touches.The apartment was so clean, bright, and well-designed that it was the perfect landing spot for two of us. It's in a great location in the Marais, which is the only part of Paris that's open on Sundays and also home to many great shops and restaurants. All the care that went into the design of the space, from the modular kitchen complete with stovetop and espresso machine to the bathroom with great water pressure in the shower, made our stay super comfortable in the 200 year old building.  The wi-fi was perfect, the views were lovely, and the bed was a luxurious cloud.We felt right at home in Paris in this dreamy apartment, thank you so much Michael!

8381199,2014-10-25,"This was my first Airbnb experience.  We were a team of 3 engineers working in San Francisco for 10 days.  Our normal choice would be to book into one of the hotels around Union Square, but this time I thought that apartment living might represent a more attractive alternative option.  How right this turned out to be. Jacque's house is amazing.  It's on two floors; bedrooms (x3, with queensize beds in each) and bathrooms (x2) on one floor and then the upper floor is a fully open plan living area; an incredible kitchen area, a long counter, smartTV with audio system and sitting room area.  The living room area is really nice, spacious and superbly finished. The bedrooms are spacious and really comfortable.The area (close to the Panhandle) is really attractive.  We found it to be a quiet, residential area, plenty of trees with  the park nearby. Streetside parking was free and easy to get, but watch out for the streetcleaning hours, clearly marked on signs.  We normally use a rental car for our San Francisco visits - next time I would consider not renting a car at all and simply using Uber (car and driver hire by smartphone on a journey by journey basis).Jacques was the best host you could ask for - he was a pleasure to deal with, he met me to hand over keys on arrival, we only saw him after that when we chose to see him.  He has a beautiful restaurant a few blocks away and we dined there once or twice. I will certainly be hoping to stay at Jacques' place again.  After spending 10 days there, it had really started to feel like home.  I was sorry to say goodbye to the house.

18193857,2014-05-03,"The location and price were fantastic. I'm less sold in the 'hacker house' concept - felt more like a sparsely populated hostel for the two weeks I was there, but I'm not complaining. There is wifi, there are plenty of places to sit down and work. The other guests were a mixed bag if interests, but some were fellow coders with interesting tech things to talk about and others less so. Mostly, though, people seemed to crash here and work elsewhere. The rooms, well, they're not great. The beds feel kinda cheap, and as a big guy sleeping on the top bunk for my first week I felt a bit nervous about the bed's structural integrity. It held, though. I will say, though, that four people in such a small room is pretty optimistic. No air conditioner and lots of bodies meant that warmer nights were a but challenging. Still, great price and great location. I recommend getting a car2go card in advance if your trip if you don't have one, because that was such an easy way to get around.

44882430,2014-05-06,"Our stay at Mary Ann's apartment in the El Born neighborhood was perfect. The apartment was very spacious with two full bathrooms and a living area/kitchen that was completely separate from the bedrooms making it feel even larger. Everything was exactly as it was depicted in the pictures online. Mary Ann was very nice and waited at the apartment for us to arrive. When we got there she gave us a quick overview of the apartment and how everything worked. She also called a cab to pick us up early in the morning when we left. The location of the apartment is perfect, right on the edge of the El Born neighborhood on the Barceloneta side so it is also not too far from the beach. The El Born neighborhood is a great place to stay with lots of beautiful shops and restaurants nearby. It is a quick 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas as well, and on the other side of that (in the Eixample neighborhood I think) there is plenty of other nightlife even though there is also plenty to do in El Born. The subway is also very close to the apartment, just a 5 minute walk. The only note I have about the apartment is that two of the bedrooms are much smaller than the master one (which has a bathroom attached), there is closet space in both so there is room to store your clothes there to save space. However, since there were only 4 of us my boyfriend and I who slept in the double bed in the smaller room, used the third bedroom as a space for our suitcases so we would not feel cramped. Either way, you will probably be spending most of your time outside of the apartment like us so this won't matter. If you are spending time in the apartment there is plenty of room in the living area to relax. I would absolutely stay at Mary Ann's apartment again and would definitely recommend it to a friend.",Awesome Flat @Borne near the beach,el Barri Gòtic,Barcelona,Catalonia,Spain,Entire home/apt,190,330

My favorite aspect is that there is a bike lane on her street. This lane leads to Griffith Park and the LA River Bike Path, or, one can easily work up to the Chandler Blvd. / Orange Like bikeway that can carry one all through the San Fernando Valley! One is literally walking distance to Disney Studios and exceedingly close to Warner Bros. & Universal. In the other direction is Burbank's fun Media Center area, with great restaurants and a huge selection of movie theaters. Nichola is a warm host. She has two beautiful dogs, a cheerful bird, and a cat that I never formally met. The room and bath are very comfortable, and Nichola offers a lot of privacy. I had a pretty rough work schedule while I was staying, and Nichola could not have been kinder. The house is very secure. It is a safe neighborhood (I lived in Burbank for many years, and the Rancho area was always considered safe), with many of the households sporting stables for horses. One is likely to see horses on the street in the mornings and afternoons! Nichola maintains a locked gate in front of the house and provides a key. So I was very comfortable leaving my bike in her yard (she offered space in her garage if I wanted it). Street parking is plentiful, although like almost everywhere, one should note that street cleaning is (as of this writing) in the mornings on Friday. Nichola herself is friendly and accommodating. She seems to genuinely enjoy life and people, and she couldn't have been better and kinder host. Highly recommended!

It didn't bother us, even though we were travelling with an infant. We think that the best part of the apartment was still the owners, Steve and Debbie (+ their 2 lovely cats), who live upstairs in the same building. They are such a nice and helpful couple - always available if we had any questions, but yet gave us our privacy in the apartment. They gave wonderful tips for seeing the city and the Napa, and the ""Not for tourists"" guidebook they borrowed us was extremely handy!

24710430,2014-05-28,"We found the accommodations as described.  The location was central to the Rialto and St. Mark’s Square.  All of Venice was within an easy ½ hour walk in all directions.  The host met us on time, and provided an overview of the apartment.  There was a washing machine, and plenty of amenities for cooking, dining, and relaxing.  We would have liked another sofa, or a comfortable chair to relax in which would enhance the atmosphere, as there is only one sofa, and a few hard plastic chairs.  The showers, there are two bathrooms, were very small and enclosed compared to North American standards, and felt very cramped and closed in.  The shower head was directly overhead, so one was unable to escape the cascade of water.  If you have an issue with claustrophobia, then you will find the showers somewhat uncomfortable, but hot water was in unending supply.Also, we had a hard time keeping the apartment warm, as it was cold for Venice standards when we were there, -3 C at night, and the radiators could not provide enough heat to keep the living space at a typical room temperature.There are approximately 90 stairs to climb, which was really no issue other than if one had heavy luggage.Over all the facilities were very comfortable and as already mentioned – exactly as described.",Design!Canal and San Marco's view ,Cannaregio,Venice,Veneto,Italy,Entire home/apt,133,310

The apartment was clean and comfortable, plenty of natural light. 3rd floor walk up with the typical narrow old building stairways so that may be a consideration with luggage but no big deal, really.No noisy neighbors...in fact we never saw another person coming or going. The downstairs is always locked.There is a bit of traffic noise (it's right next to the Brooklyn/Queens Expwy) that may disturb some but Mike has a ""white noise"" machine that will help with that.Mike was willing to meet me 3 days before our stay (I was already in NY) to give me the keys when I happened to be in Williamsburg.The subway is an easy 4 blocks away to the L, 6 blocks to the G.The ""hip"" shopping area is also a close walk.

The location of the flat was ideal. Right in the center of the lagoon. Just steps away from the Rialto bridge and all the major historical attractions.It was good for one person. Maybe two. It is small which is to be expected for the area and age of the building. It's tucked inside of a darling courtyard with a pretty fountain outside.The bathroom is quite small. I am 6ft tall & 150 pounds. I barely fit. I washed my hair over the sink which protrudes from the side of the wall opposite the shower. If you are taller or wider than me, it will be a tight fit.

Cheap bed, very cheap pillows (they slept like that too).Cheap cleaning: a bit of sweeping, not even vacuum cleaning or mopping the floor.

They were not even big enough to cover the windowsBad state of the bathroom: you cannot hang the shower on a hook if you are not having the master bedroom so you'll just have to hold it in your hands. No shower curtain so bathroom becomes all wet. All wet bathroom so the floor is breaking up. The toilet in the bathroom doesn't flush well (it took me only 20 tries).The only good things: -the person looking after the house was very friendly and gave me the master bedroom because of the shower problem and one of the blinds being broken (it was on a desk instead of on the wall...)-the cleaning lady was very friendly too-the appartement is close to a metro station and in a quiet, safe area",14.

Supermarket and a good bakery around the corner and lots of Indian shops to buy fruit and vegetables. Only thing we missed was a nice little French cafe to eat our morning croissant and coffee.

I was never in a hurry each day to leave the house because it felt so comfortable and the view was spectacular. I would even try to go back home early to catch the sunset. Which I even did on my last day so I could take souvenir photos. The buffet breakfast is indeed available all day! And yes the brewed coffee is from dunkin' donuts! :-) I even had home cooked meals courtesy of the couple and another very friendly chap from Spain renting the other room, who cooked us paella and Spanish omelette. And it was really good considering it was his first time to cook. The home cooked meals though do not come free with the stay and have to be earned according to Amy :-). So be nice!The neighborhood is charming, quiet and friendly. I hope you all get to see the nice old Buick near the house that a very friendly neighbor owns.

Loydeen wasn't home during my stay, therefore, 2 other travelers I lived with and the vibe was very comfortable living with them. The view of the city was nice (be careful no screen, don't lean out to far). I'd recommend taking a look at the apt before deciding, just to make sure the space you are renting and cleanliness is ok with you. Also, you would be able to get a feel of the building and the area in general. You should be fine, if you know how to carry yourself on the streets.positive note: the 125th 4,5,6 train is 3 blocks up, tremendous! There is no AC in any of the rooms, only in the living room, so hopefully you have a fan & thats sufficient for you. The room, I rented had someone else things in it that took half the closet space and the entire under the bed space. Broken, old dressers with someone else dirty things in them. So, make sure you take it all in account before you pay the price you might pay somewhere else for more space and cleaner bedskirts, bathrooms, building, laundry facilities, etc.. Parking is unmanageable, looking for hours in the middle of the night.. wracked up $800 worth of tickets because we can't park in the lot at the building because we are there illegally (so says the association). However, the front desk guys, not sure what they do really lol are VERY nice and helpful. Helping me move out and always asking about my wellbeing and living situation. Overall, wherever you are, be there fully and be grateful. But this was a stretch for me, as I've never lived like this before. Living with 3 people and one bathroom is also a situation but you get what you sign up for. Best of luck!

We were a bit nervous about the location at first, but again we were pleasantly surprised.  The neighborhood is very nice, super charming, close walking distance to everything, there's a pharmacy, a butcher, and a bakery right on the corner, and there is the coolest street market a block away.

There is also a metro stop extremely close by, so very convenient for traveling.However, the appartment itself is just okay at best, which is fine if you're out all day anyway. The things I didn't like were the smell from the kitchen below coming especially into the bedroom, the shower drain getting clogged, the doves that like to hang out next to the bedroom window cooing all morning, and the laundry facility being in the restaurant basement... But it was quiet, had a lovely balcony and good kitchen facilities.I also have to admit that the quality of her restaurant, just below the apartment, I found low. I had a 'green soup' that was possibly spinach, I couldn't really tell, and overcooked sticky pasta in cream sauce that was not very good. However, in fairness, all the food we ate in Brussels was much worse than any other city we stayed because I think the demand for high quantity production is so high to meet the demand of millions of tourists each day, the quality is really lost.Aside from that, Dominique herself was very nice and great at communicating before our visit. She did seem like she was slightly tired of meeting a million people that stay at her place, so was very straight forward... but still nice.","Heart of Brussels,Halles St. Gery",Bruxelles,Brussels,Brussels,Belgium,Entire home/apt,85,342

1086998,2013-10-23,"My partner and I had to move to London in late March in order for him to begin his new job in early April. We initially tried looking for flats to rent  on gumtree and other sites; however, we were not having much luck. We, therefore, resorted to a temporary, yet longer than normal stay with the Brodies.Firstly, I should say that Philip and his wife were very accommodating and easy to work with in terms of booking the room. If you have any questions and concerns, Philip makes himself available by phone and email to answer questions and abet any concerns.Initially, we were worried about booking because it is someone's house and not a real bnb or hotel. In such a case, there is always worry about house rules, personalities, and scamming. Let me just say that the house has a very welcoming atmosphere and the Brodies are extremely easy going, helpful, and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home. For example, when we arrived at Acton Central Station, Mr. Brodie picked us up and after arrival we all shared a glass of wine together - pure class!The comforts of staying here are several fold, but first let me say I much enjoyed being able to cook. The Brodies also cook, but it is a really simple matter to just ask and plan in advance for kitchen time. The room itself is very cozy and you have control of the heating unit. Though the bed comes with a very heavy and nice duvet comforter. The bed itself is amazing. I had really relaxing and rejuvenating sleeps. In terms of other common areas like the bathroom or toilet room, it is very clean and I really enjoyed the warm soaking bath. Towels were also provided here.Overall, my partner and I had an extremely comfortable and pleasant stay and I highly recommend this place for anyone: whether you need short term stay in London to search for a flat (which is time consuming and very difficult, especially through an agent) or if you want to stay in London for a short while to experience the Olympics or if you're on holiday, this is a very economical, gay friendly, and convenient location to choose for your London visit. Much better than staying in over priced hotels. As for transportation, the Acton Central overground is just 5 mins away or the East Acton station, which connects with the central line tube, is just a 15 min walk.If you are thinking about coming to London and need a longer than usual stay for whatever your reasons might be, this place is highly desirable and I assure you that you will not regret staying here.Best and Happy Journeys,Tony and Scottie",Double Room in  Edwardian House,Ealing,London,England,United Kingdom,Private room,49,360

Room is on quieter side of the street and close to cafes, bars, transport links and mini supermarkets are 5-10 away, walking.There's no microwave so if you are cooking use the oven or saucepan (some in room), no chopping board, knife or oven dish so pick something prepared if eating in. The duvet is a feather one and it's winter thickness so not so comfortable now in summer. The host can easily change this. Being feather it smells. I found this a little off putting.

Host was immediately available for anything we needed, and even gave us a crib for our infant. Does have small elevator, but is far from apartment so we didn't use. 4 floor walk up. Is truly the top floor, and attic. Very small attic bedrooms and shower with low ceilings. Is not very kid friendly, especially with the hosts ""very valuable"" motorcycle and windows which he warns about right before your trip. Nor are the stairs to the bedrooms kid friendly at all. The bathrooms are on some weird pump system which doesn't work well and smells when used. Two people can't bathe at the same time. Also, someone obviously smokes in the apartment sometimes, as you can occasionally smell it. Wifi is intermittent at best. One must keep rebooting the router.
